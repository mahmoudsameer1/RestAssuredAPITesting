Welcome to the REST Assured TestNG project! This project is focused on automating API testing using REST Assured, a powerful Java library for testing RESTful APIs, along with the TestNG framework for efficient test management and execution. By combining these tools, we can create robust and maintainable API test suites. In this project, we have designed a suite of test cases to validate various endpoints and functionalities of an API. Leveraging REST Assured's fluent and expressive syntax, we can easily construct HTTP requests, send them to the API, and verify the responses. TestNG provides features such as parameterization, dependency management, and test prioritization, allowing us to organize and execute tests effectively.
